# Quick-Certificate-Generator
MATLAB, Certificate image, Excel Sheet with particulars to be filled

To find (X,Y) coordinates in pixels of the point from where the text has to inserted in the certificate image I used MS Paint.
Open the original certificate image in MS Paint.
Point a pencil or pointer to the point where you want to start the text in all your certificates that will be generated.
The pixels of the position will appear in the bar at the bottom.
Refer to Screenshot.png to view visually.

POINTS TO NOTE:
list.xlsx was the list I used.
jrexcom.png was my original certificate image.
The above to must be in the same file as the one on which the MATLAB program is saved.
Other images were generated when I ran the program certigen.m on MATLAB.

You can adjust the code according to your requirements and all more lines incase or more columns
